This project demonstrates database schema migrations for a simple Student Management System in .NET using Entity Framework Core.

We chose to start with the EF/Code first approach. With this, Entity Framework tracks model changes in the code, and generates migration files that evolve the database schema step by step.

We started with creating a new .NET console project,
Then we installed the necessary EF Core packages via NuGet:
Microsoft.EntityFrameworkCore
Microsoft.EntityFrameworkCore.SqlServer
Microsoft.EntityFrameworkCore.Tools
Then we created the models.
We created a DbCointext file, with connection string to LocalDB.
Here we added the inital migration, using the command:
dotnet ef migrations add InitalCreate
And then updated it, using 
dotnet ef database update.

The reasoning for this approach is that it provides a clear history of schema changes. Each migration file documents how the schema evolved.

Question in: 5. Rename Grade attribute to FinalGrade in Enrollment
Some changes (like adding MiddleName or DateOfBirth) are non-destructive, since they extend the schema. 
Others (like renaming Grade to FinalGrade) are destructive, as EF replaces the column and data could be lost. 
In this project itâ€™s acceptable, since no real data exists yet.
